# Singleton Pattern

## Purpose
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## When to Use
- When exactly one instance of a class is needed
- When you need stricter control over global variables
- When a single instance should be extensible by subclassing

## Real-World Examples
- Database connections
- Configuration managers
- Logging services
- File systems

## Implementation Details
The implementation includes:
- Private constructor
- Static instance storage
- Public static access method

## Usage Example 
typescript
const instance = Singleton.getInstance();
instance.someOperation();

## Benefits
- Controlled access to sole instance
- Reduced namespace
- Permits refinement of operations
- Permits variable number of instances
- More flexible than static methods

## Drawbacks
- Can make unit testing difficult
- Can be seen as an anti-pattern in some cases
- Can make code coupling tighter
