# Builder Pattern

## Purpose
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## When to Use
- When you need to create complex objects step by step
- When you want to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code
- When you need to build objects that require multiple steps or configurations

## Real-World Examples
- Building a custom computer (adding components step by step)
- Creating complex documents (PDF, HTML, etc.)
- Configuring network connections
- Building complex API requests

## Implementation Details
The implementation includes:
- Builder interface defining all construction steps
- Concrete builders implementing the steps
- Director class defining the order of steps
- Product being constructed

## Benefits
- Allows you to vary a product's internal representation
- Encapsulates code for construction and representation
- Provides control over the construction process
- Allows fine control over the construction process

## Drawbacks
- Requires creating multiple new classes
- Code can become more complex
- May be overkill for simple objects
