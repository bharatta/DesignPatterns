# Prototype Pattern

## Purpose
The Prototype pattern allows you to create new objects by cloning an existing object, known as the prototype, instead of creating new instances from scratch.

## When to Use
- When creating an object is more expensive than copying an existing one
- When your system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented
- When instances of a class can have only a few different combinations of state
- When you need to create objects that are similar to existing objects

## Real-World Examples
1. Document Copying
   - Creating copies of documents with similar content but minor variations
   - Duplicating form templates with shared base structure

2. Game Development
   - Spawning multiple similar game objects (enemies, items)
   - Creating variations of base character types

3. Configuration Objects
   - Creating multiple instances of similar configuration settings
   - Cloning base settings and modifying specific properties

## Implementation Details
The implementation includes:
- A prototype interface declaring the cloning method
- Concrete prototype classes implementing the cloning method
- Support for shallow and deep copying
- Handling of circular references

## Usage Example 
typescript
// Create initial prototype
const prototype = new Prototype();
prototype.primitive = 245;
prototype.component = new Date();
// Clone the prototype
const clone = prototype.clone();
// Verify the clone
console.log(prototype.primitive === clone.primitive); // true
console.log(prototype.component === clone.component); // false (deep copy)

## Benefits
- Reduces subclassing
- Hides complexities of creating new instances
- Provides great flexibility in creating new objects
- Reduces the need for factory classes
- Allows adding/removing products at runtime

## Drawbacks
- Cloning complex objects with circular references might be challenging
- Deep copying of complex objects can be complicated
- Managing prototype registry might add complexity

## Best Practices
1. Implement a proper deep cloning mechanism
2. Handle circular references carefully
3. Consider using serialization for complex objects
4. Document the cloning behavior
5. Consider implementing a prototype registry if needed

## Related Patterns
- Abstract Factory: Often uses prototype pattern
- Composite: Can use prototype for copying complex structures
- Decorator: Can be used with prototype to copy decorated objects
