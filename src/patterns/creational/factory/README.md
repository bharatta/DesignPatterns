# Factory Pattern - Payment Processing Example

## Purpose
The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating payment processing methods without explicitly specifying their exact classes. This allows for flexible payment method integration and easy addition of new payment types.

## Real-World Use Case
An e-commerce platform that needs to handle multiple payment methods:
- Credit Card payments
- PayPal payments
- Cryptocurrency payments

Each payment method has its own:
- Validation rules
- Processing logic
- Security requirements

## Implementation Details

### 1. Interfaces
```typescript
interface IPaymentMethod {
  processPayment(amount: number): string;
  validatePayment(): boolean;
  getPaymentDetails(): string;
}

interface IPaymentMethodCreator {
  createPaymentMethod(): IPaymentMethod;
  executePayment(amount: number): string;
}
```

### 2. Usage Example
```typescript
// Create payment processor using factory
const creditCardProcessor = new CreditCardPaymentCreator();
const paypalProcessor = new PayPalPaymentCreator();

// Process payments
creditCardProcessor.executePayment(100);  // Processes $100 via Credit Card
paypalProcessor.executePayment(100);      // Processes $100 via PayPal
```

## Benefits
1. **Encapsulation**: Payment processing details are hidden from the client code
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new payment methods without changing existing code
3. **Consistency**: All payment methods follow the same interface
4. **Maintainability**: Each payment method can be modified independently
5. **Testability**: Easy to mock and test different payment scenarios

## When to Use
- When you need to support multiple payment methods
- When payment processing logic varies by payment type
- When you want to add new payment methods without changing existing code
- When you need consistent payment processing interfaces

## Best Practices
1. Keep payment method creation separate from business logic
2. Implement proper validation for each payment method
3. Handle payment processing errors gracefully
4. Follow security best practices for each payment type
5. Use meaningful names for payment-related classes and methods
